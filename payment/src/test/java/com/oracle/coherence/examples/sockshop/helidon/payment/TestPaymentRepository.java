/**
 * Tests may need additional methods in repository implementations
 * in order to pre-load test data, clear the repository between the
 * test, etc.
 *
 * <p>The methods needed only for the tests should reside in the test
 * project, to avoid polluting production repository implementation
 * with methods it a) doesn't need, and b) may be downright dangerous.
 *
 * <p>Note that for the CDI to work it is necessary to mark the test
 * repositories with @Alternative and @Priority exceeding that of the
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>Note that for the tests to test the actual implementation it is
 * necessary that the test implementations only extend the repository
 * class and add methods, but do not override any methods from the
 * repository implementation they are testing.
